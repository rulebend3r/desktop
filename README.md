# rulebend3r_desktop

mostly for my personal use, this repo contains just my basic desktop/zsh/vim setup for Gentoo/Arch/Debian.

ftr, this setup is used primarily for Gentoo with XFCE4 on a 1920x1080 display.

in the coming weeks, Ill upload some goodies Ive been working on including a twitter client (cuz lets face it, all linux twitter clients are UGLY) for Arch Linux (AUR).

twitter handle = @rulebend3r

4070 for life!

also thanks to my wife for putting up with my tech shenanigans!
